                    <p>Resident Evil 4 isn't like its predecessors. Resident Evil 4 had many new dynamics that had a huge impact on the action game genre. The game had six new game mechanics that made it the most successful and influential game in the series. These six new dynamics are a third person view, saving system, quick time events, Player decision making, tetris style inventory, and an inventory upgrade merchant. So these seem like small little changes so why were they so widely appreciated. Well these made the game feel better to play. They added more action and made the game more fun and exciting. It was fresh and fun. The most interesting of these six are the player decision and the inventory system. The player decision system was you as the player could give three commands to your comrade. These commands were wait, follow, or hide. You could alter your gameplay or game style to the situation you were in and it made the game feel more personal and action pack because you were making the calls not the game. </p>
                    <p>Secondly the inventory used a tetris like system to organise itself. So cut up in blocks a rifle would take up more room by filling up these square spaces unlike a grenade so you would have to treat your inventory kinda realistically because its almost impossible to carry too many weapons on hand and bag. This made the game super exciting in game play because it gave the player many actions. From sorting their inventory to what they feel is best all the way to what commands they want to give so their outcome is always different. These dynamics allowed various ways a player could finish the game. </p>
                    <p>They also have side effects so if a player makes a wrong command or packs their inventory wrong they could be punished down the line or instantly. A wrong command could be what just leads the player to demise or maybe to intense action. Same thing with the inventory, packing too many hand guns could prevent the player from using an actual gun that would get the job done. Players can challenge themselves with these new mechanics or help make their game as easy as they can. </p>
