                    <p>Resident evil 4 gives the player a lot of input when it comes to their game style as mentioned previously. So to keep the player on track the levels are designed in a way that it always navigates the player forwards. Meaning that the player is always moving towards an objective and never gets lost because there is no backtracking. This method of level design is awesome because for player simplicity they don't have to worry about making the wrong move for the story line, they can enjoy the story with the decisions previously mentioned above. The goals seem very intended for the story line. They make sense and they are always something the player needs. This keeps the player interested and active because they run into an issue and then need to beat there level to get what they need but as soon as that happens another problem arises causing them to fall victim to a really fun game loop where the player never wants to stop playing because every bit more they put in the more they solve. </p>
                    <p>The dynamic difficulty system was an awesome feature that was added to this title. The game adjusted to you the player. You learned as you went on but the game always adjusted itself to always be a little challenging. This was so if you were really good at the game it would make you even better. This also goes for those first time playing. People who aren't good at the game face the game with a easier difficulty but still challenging enough to make the player hone in and grow as a player as the game goes on. This feature always kept the game fun because it prevented some levels from being too difficult for a person but also kept them from being too easy. People get bored when a game is too easy and people don't want to play a game that's not fun to play so having this system was the ideal method to keep players having wonderful hours of game time as they binged the top title of the survival genre in its release. </p>
