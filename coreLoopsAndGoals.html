                        Resident Evil 4 core game loops are quite simple as the
                        player goes through the game; they will do the same
                        actions with little change. Most of the game the player
                        will be shooting or stabbing the enemies or running
                        around to escapee an enemy or to explore the area, first
                        new areas will have enemies, the player kills the enemy
                        while protecting one of or both of the games main
                        characters agent Leon S. Kennedy and the U.S.
                        president's daughter Ashley Graham, depending on how far
                        the player is in the game. Next is exploring the area
                        and searching for anything needed for story progression
                        during this the player might encounter some more enemies
                        and have to kill them, the player will either discover
                        more areas to kill enemies and explore in or have some
                        story progression show them what the next goal is or the
                        next area to go to is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During this loop the player will have many small goals
                        to achieve some are as simple as shoot this enemy in the
                        head, or run because the player is low on ammo or
                        surrounded while some small goals are, I need to get
                        over there or how do I get past this new enemy I have
                        never fought before. This is all the small second by
                        second goals the player deals with; larger goals minute
                        by minute will be harder to achieve with small goals
                        making one larger one such as a boss fight, new
                        mechanics for different areas in the game or multistep
                        objectives. The core game loop and goals in Resident
                        Evil 4 although simple are very enjoyable and
                        entertaining for the player, every new area could have a
                        new enemy with different way for kill it or maybe the
                        new area will give the player some story to invest
                        themselves in, the goals change throughout the game for
                        new areas and actions that happened during the
                        storyline. With the game starting off easy to help the
                        player learn the loop before showing the player the fun
                        and challenging ways the game uses the core game loop to
                        keep the player entertained and surprised.
