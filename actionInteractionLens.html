                        Most Actions the player takes can be separated into two
                        distinct categories combat and traversal. When it comes
                        to the design of these categories it’s clear that much
                        more time went into making one of them as fun and well
                        designed as possible and saw the other one as something
                        not worth as much attention. The only part of this game
                        that you can argue doesn’t hold up to today’s standards
                        is the movement. It’s not bad per se, but it’s tank
                        controls and camera that can only pan 90º left or right
                        before snapping back to the center feel somewhat clunky
                        nowadays to use without the level of easy control that
                        modern game protagonists possess. The movement does feel
                        responsive and once you get used to it and it can be
                        quite easy to use, but it never manages to feel like
                        more than a supplementary mechanic that allows the
                        player to get from one combat encounter to another. But
                        that’s where the Action comes in.

                        Capcom Production Studio 4 obviously worked incredibly
                        hard on making the combat interactions as fun and
                        impactful as they could be, even if they didn’t put
                        anywhere near the same level of effort into their team
                        name. You can’t move and aim at the same time so when
                        you are trying to aim your shot just right you have an
                        obvious time limit, so making those perfect shots feels
                        even more enjoyable. What makes the aiming even more
                        interesting is how enemy models have different weak
                        points that will stagger them in different ways which
                        can lead to different melee attacks once staggered,
                        making you choose between taking the time to aim just
                        right or just trying to hit them if you don’t have any
                        time. Also, it’s worth saying how fun those melee
                        attacks are as a reward for careful shooting with such
                        flashy moves and excellent sound design making those few
                        moments when you can press the contextual melee button
                        on the enemy as impactful and enjoyable as possible.
                        Thanks to the amazing combat design, the game makes sure
                        you take advantage of every single type of combat
                        interaction since your ammo is always running low, you
                        often feel forced to use every tool you have at your
                        disposal to get through each encounter. Even the flash
                        grenade which felt useless at first and I never
                        interacted with, had a secret purpose I found much later
                        into the game, that being that is could instantly kill
                        all nearby plagas enemies, turning an item I previously
                        never used into my secret weapon that I would save for
                        when I was feeling too overwhelmed by the hordes.
                        Overall, though the navigation interactions can feel
                        clunky and take a while to get the hang of, the combat
                        interactions are top tier action design, making every
                        combat interaction as fun and tense as it can be.
